# Chapter 7: Design a Unique ID Generator in Distributed Systems

## Introduction
This chapter addresses the challenge of designing a **unique ID generator** for distributed systems. Traditional auto-increment keys are unsuitable in distributed environments due to scalability and synchronization challenges. The focus is on creating unique, sortable, 64-bit numerical IDs that meet the following requirements:
- IDs must be **unique** and **ordered by date**.
- IDs must fit within **64 bits**.
- The system should generate **over 10,000 IDs per second**.

---

## Step 1: Understanding the Problem
### Basic Requirements
- IDs must be unique and numerical and should fit in 64 bits.
- IDs increment with time but not strictly by `+1`.
- IDs should be sortable by date.
- System must handle high throughput (10,000 IDs/sec).

---

## Step 2: High-Level Design Options
### 1. Multi-Master Replication
- **Approach:** Use database `auto_increment` with step increments (e.g., `+k` for k servers).

    </p>

- **Drawbacks:**
  - Hard to scale across data centers.
  - IDs do not always increase with time.
  - Scaling issues when servers are added/removed.

### 2. UUID (Universally Unique Identifier)
- **Approach:** 
    - Generate 128-bit unique identifiers independently on each server using UUID.
    - UUIDs can be generated independently without coordination between servers

        </p>

- **Advantages:**
  - No coordination needed between servers.
  - Scales easily with web servers.
- **Drawbacks:**
  - Exceeds 64-bit requirement.
  - IDs are not sortable by time and may be non-numeric.


### 3. Ticket Server
- **Approach:** Use a centralized database server to increment and assign IDs.

    </p>

- **Advantages:**
  - Simple to implement for small-scale systems.
  - Generates numeric IDs.
- **Drawbacks:**
  - Single point of failure.
  - Synchronization challenges in multi-server setups.

### 4. Twitter Snowflake Approach
- **Approach:**

    <div style="margin-left:3rem">
      <img src="./images/snowflake-id-breakdown.png"  alt="Snowflake ID breakdow" width="500">
    </div>

    - Divide IDs into sections to ensure uniqueness and scalability.
    - **Sign Bit (1 bit):** Always `0`, potentially distinguishing signed and unsigned numbers.
    - **Timestamp (41 bits):** Milliseconds since a custom epoch (Twitter's default is `1288834974657`, equivalent to Nov 04, 2010, 01:42:54 UTC). Ensures IDs are time-ordered.
    - **Datacenter ID (5 bits):** Identifies up to `2^5 = 32` datacenters.
    - **Machine ID (5 bits):** Identifies up to `2^5 = 32` machines within each datacenter.
    - **Sequence Number (12 bits):** Tracks IDs generated on a machine within the same millisecond, supporting up to `2^12 = 4096` IDs per millisecond. The sequence resets to `0` every millisecond.



- **Advantages:**
    - **Scalability:** Handles 10,000+ IDs per second across multiple servers.
    - **Time-Order:** Ensures IDs are sortable by time.
    - **Decentralization:** No single point of failure.


## Step 4: Additional Considerations
### 1. Clock Synchronization
- **Challenge:** ID generation assumes synchronized clocks across servers.
- **Solution:** Use **Network Time Protocol (NTP)** to minimize drift.

### 2. Section Length Tuning
- Adjust section sizes (e.g., fewer sequence bits, more timestamp bits) based on use case.

### 3. High Availability
- ID generators are mission-critical and must be fault-tolerant.
- Consider redundancy and failover mechanisms.
